# Onboards one tenant end to end against WSO2 Identity Server + the Developer
# Portal, driven entirely by that tenant's own artifact directory
# (artifacts/via-script/$ORG_NAME/ — apis/, mcps/, applications.yaml,
# subscription-plans.yaml). The bundled tenants are "public" (unauthenticated
# catalogue, no applications), "acme" and "railco". Steps:
#
#   1. Registers the organization in IS (safe to re-run — an existing org is
#      looked up rather than re-created), shares the root API Portal SP to it
#      if it has no copy yet, configures that fragment copy (password grant,
#      JWT access tokens with roles/groups, profile claim mappings — a
#      freshly shared application does NOT inherit any of this), and
#      provisions its users:
#        - "${ORG_NAME}admin" (role dp_admin) — always. Does every
#          admin-level step below (plans, APIs/MCPs, key manager, webhook)
#          since dp_subscriber cannot.
#        - "${ORG_NAME}user" (role dp_subscriber) — only when this org's
#          applications.yaml lists at least one application. Nothing in
#          this script acts on applications.yaml's actual content anymore
#          (see steps 5/6 below) — only whether it has any entries at all,
#          as the signal for whether this org gets a subscriber persona to
#          log in as and do that part by hand in the portal.
#      Credentials for both are printed once, right after creation.
#   2. Creates this organization's OWN OAuth2 application directly in the
#      ROOT organization (client_credentials grant, not shared/org-scoped)
#      — its client_id/secret are what a caller outside the portal uses to
#      get a token, and what step 5 configures as this org's key manager
#      client. Living in the root org (not inside the sub-org) means this
#      client's own token endpoint is the plain root-level one
#      ($IS_URL/oauth2/token), not an org-scoped $IS_URL/o/{orgId}/... one.
#   3. Seeds this organization's subscription plans from
#      subscription-plans.yaml (design-mode schema) via the real
#      subscription-plans REST API — PUT is an upsert, one plan per request
#      (the API silently no-ops on an array body when
#      organization.autoCreateSubscriptionPlans is enabled, which it is by
#      default). An org whose plans file has no entries (see "public" in
#      artifacts/via-script/) keeps its auto-seeded defaults
#      (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Unlimited) instead.
#   4. Seeds this organization's APIs and MCP servers from apis/ and mcps/,
#      via seed-samples.sh (SAMPLES_DIR pointed at this org's directory),
#      each rewritten to advertise exactly the plans from step 3
#      (PLAN_OVERRIDE) rather than whatever its sample api.yaml originally
#      listed.
#   5. Configures a key manager (KEY_MANAGER_HANDLE) pointing at step 2's
#      root-org client's own token endpoint — this portal's key managers
#      are deliberately thin (no DCR, no stored secret; just a displayName
#      + the tokenEndpoint the portal proxies client_credentials requests
#      to — see docs/administer/key-manager-integration.md). Then registers
#      a webhook subscriber (WEBHOOK_SUBSCRIBER_ID) delivering
#      subscription.*/apikey.* events to WEBHOOK_TARGET_URL.
#   6. Prints the root-level token endpoint and this org's OAuth2 client
#      id/secret, plus an example curl to redeem them for a token directly.
#      Creating a portal application and subscribing it to APIs is NOT done
#      by this script — that's a manual step via the portal UI, using the
#      "${ORG_NAME}user" credentials printed in step 1.
#
# Prerequisites — one-time IS setup, done once for the whole deployment, not
# per tenant (see scripts/setup_idp.sh, which automates all of this):
#   - An OIDC application ("API Portal" or similar) registered in the root
#     organization. That root application's own client_id/client_secret and
#     id are passed as ROOT_APP_CLIENT_ID / ROOT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET /
#     ROOT_APP_ID. Sharing it to this tenant is NOT a prerequisite — step 1b
#     below issues the share itself (shareWithAllChildren) whenever the
#     organization it just registered has no copy of the application yet,
#     which is the normal state for an organization created after
#     setup_idp.sh last ran.
#   - "dp_admin" and "dp_subscriber" roles must exist on the root application
#     as SHARED roles (Console > that application > Roles > Add Role, with
#     "Share with all organizations" on) — this is what makes them appear on
#     every organization's fragment application automatically, so step 1
#     only ever has to assign a user to them, never create them. Both names
#     must match keys in the Developer Portal's own
#     [api_portal.auth.authorization.portal_roles] config ("admin"/
#     "subscriber" respectively) for the resulting tokens to authorize
#     anything.
#   - ROOT_APP_CLIENT_ID must be authorized (Console > that application >
#     API Authorization, or POST .../authorized-apis) for:
#       * internal_org_application_mgt_view, internal_org_application_mgt_update
#         on the "Application Management API" (identifier
#         /o/api/server/v1/applications) — configures each organization's
#         fragment application (step 1b). No _create scope needed here: this
#         script no longer creates any application *inside* a sub-org (step 2's
#         OAuth2 client now lives in the root organization instead, created
#         with IS_ADMIN_USERNAME/IS_ADMIN_PASSWORD, not this scope).
#       * internal_org_user_mgt_create, internal_org_user_mgt_list,
#         internal_org_user_mgt_view on the "SCIM2 Users API" (identifier
#         /o/scim2/Users) — creates and looks up the org's users (step 1).
#       * internal_org_role_mgt_view, internal_org_role_mgt_update on the
#         "SCIM2 Roles API" (identifier /o/scim2/Roles) — assigns roles to
#         those users (step 1).
#   - IS_ADMIN_USERNAME/IS_ADMIN_PASSWORD (default admin/admin) need rights
#     to create applications in the root organization — step 2's OAuth2
#     client is created there directly via Basic Auth, the same credentials
#     this script already uses for organization registration/lookup.
#
# Usage:
#   ORG_NAME=acme ROOT_APP_CLIENT_ID=... ROOT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=... ROOT_APP_ID=... \
#     ./scripts/onboard-tenant.sh
#
# SAMPLE_DIR (optional, default: ORG_NAME) names which artifacts/via-script/
# subdirectory to seed from — set it when the IS organization name can't (or
# shouldn't) match the artifact bundle's own directory name, e.g. WSO2 IS
# refuses to reuse a deleted organization's name (deleting an organization
# only deactivates its underlying tenant record, it does not free the name):
#   ORG_NAME=acme-demo SAMPLE_DIR=acme ROOT_APP_CLIENT_ID=... ... \
#     ./scripts/onboard-tenant.sh
#
# SAMPLES_ROOT (optional) overrides the directory those subdirectories are
# looked up under, for a checkout laid out differently from this one.
#
# ORG_ADMIN_PASSWORD / ORG_USER_PASSWORD (optional) pin the two users'
# passwords instead of generating (and re-printing, on every run without
# one) a random one each time.
#
# KEY_MANAGER_HANDLE (default "wso2-is") names the portal-side key manager
# step 5 configures. IS_INTERNAL_URL (default "https://is.wso2.com:9444")
# is that key manager's token endpoint's HOST — it must be reachable from the
# PORTAL CONTAINER (not this script, not a browser), a different
# reachability requirement than every other *_URL var below.
#
# IS_URL / API_PORTAL_URL / IS_ADMIN_USERNAME / IS_ADMIN_PASSWORD override the
# defaults below. Safe to re-run: an existing organization/user/application/
# plan/key manager is reused rather than duplicated, and re-running never
# demotes or removes anything a previous run created.
